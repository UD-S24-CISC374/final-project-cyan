# Blurb

Boolean Bonanza is a dynamic puzzle game where players are presented with a grid of squares labeled with boolean values and operators such as True, False, And, Or and Not. The goal of the game is to click and move these blocks throughout the rows and columns of the grid to craft a boolean statement that evaluates to True. After successfully making a row or column that evaluates to True, the row or column will be cleared from the grid and the player will add points to their score. Boolean Bonanza is designed to offer a fun way to learn boolean logic.

# Basic Instructions

Starting the Game

-   Select one of the three options on the menu:
    -   Tutorial (An interactive walkthrough of the game)
    -   Play 3 x 3 (A game mode that presents a 3 x 3 grid of boolean blocks and operators)
    -   Play 5 x 5 (A game mode that presents a 5 x 5 grid of boolean blocks and operators)

Gameplay Instructions

-   Interact with the grid by clicking on one of the blocks. (The block will be tinted indicating you have clicked on it)
-   Click on another block to swap its position with your already selected block.
-   Maneuver the blocks in this manner to make a row or column that demonstrates a boolean statement that evaluates to True such as:
    -   T AND T
    -   F OR T
    -   T AND T OR F

Scoring / Time

-   After making a row or column that evaluates to True, the row or column will disappear and add points to the player's score.
-   The player must make as many True boolean statements as they can before the time limit in the corner of the screen runs out and ends the game
